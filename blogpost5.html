            I just returned from a three month sabbatical spent mostly offline diving through history and I feel like
            I've returned to an alien planet full of serious utopian and dystopian thinking swirling simultaneously. I
            find myself nodding along because both the best case and worst case scenarios could happen. But also
            cringing because the passion behind these declarations has no room for nuance. Everything feels extreme and
            fully of binaries. I am truly astonished by the the deeply entrenched deterministic thinking that feels
            pervasive in these conversations.
            <br><br>
            Deterministic thinking is a blinkering force, the very opposite of rationality even though many people who
            espouse deterministic thinking believe themselves to be hyper rational. Deterministic thinking tends to seed
            polarization and distrust as people become entrenched in their vision of the future. Returning to the modern
            world, I'm finding myself frantically waving my hands in a desperate attempt to get those around me to take
            a deep breath (or maybe 100 of them). Given that few people can see my hand movements from my home office,
            I'm going to pretend like it's 2004 and blog my thoughts in the hopes that this post might calm at least one
            person down. Or, maybe, if I'm lucky, it'll be fed into an AI model and add a tiny bit of nuance.
            What is deterministic thinking?
            <br><br>
            Simply put, determinism is “if x, then y.” It is the notion that if we do something (x), a particular
            outcome (y) is inevitable. Determinisms are not inherently positive or negative. It is just as deterministic
            to say “if we build social media, the world will be a more connected place” as it is to say “social media
            will destroy democracy.”
            <br><br>
            It is extraordinarily common for people who are excited about a particular technology to revert to
            deterministic thinking. And they're often egged on to do so. Venture capitalists want to hear deterministic
            thinking in sales pitches. Same with the National Science Foundation. In many social science fields, these
            futuristic speech acts gets labeled in a pejorative manner as “technological determinism.” Inventors and
            corporations are often accused of being deterministic, which is a shorthand intended to dismiss their
            rhetoric as ahistoric and socially oblivious. (Academics who study technological determinism are often more
            nuanced in this scholarship than their blog posts and op-eds.)
            <br><br>
            Meanwhile, however, tech critics often fall into the same trap. Many professional critics (including
            academics, journalists, advocates) are incentivized to do so because such rhetoric appeals to funders and
            makes for fantastic opinion pieces. Their rhetoric is rarely labeled deterministic because that's not the
            language of futurists. Rather, they are typically dismissed as being clueless about technology and
            anti-progress. They're regularly not invited to “the party” (where the technology is being debated by those
            involved in creating it) because they're seen as depressing.
            <br><br>
            Determinism's ugly step-sibling is “solutionism.” Solutionism is the belief that x will be a solution not
            just to achieve y but to achieve all possibly y's. Solutionists tend to be so enamored with x that they
            cannot engage with any criticism of x.
            <br><br>
            In a world where technologies are given power, authority, and funding, those with positive deterministic
            views (and solutionistic mindsets) often have more resources and power, leading to a mutually
            self-destructive polar vortex rich with righteousness that is anything but rational. This is often visible
            through shouting matches. Right now, the cacophony is overwhelming. And it's breaking my brain.
