            Jimmy slipped off his sandals to bask his feet in the morning sunlight.
            <br><br>
            “Dude, check out this video on my Insta feed,” Jimmy said, holding up his phone. “It's some dude playing
            ping pong with his cat.”
            <br><br>
            “No offense, Jimmy, but how about we just talk,” Mark said with a smile, adding, “I'm kind of sick of
            screens.”
            <br><br>
            “Oh, okay…sure.” Jimmy slipped the phone into his jacket pocket.
            <br><br>
            The morning air was crisp, and the sun warmed them both. Not many people were in the plaza, and a kind of
            stillness filled the air. Mark took a bite of his pastry and Jimmy sipped his latte.
            <br><br>
            “So, I have some news,” Mark said.
            <br><br>
            “I quit working for Awaken.ai and I'm leaving California,” Mark said softly.
            <br><br>
            “Are you shitting me? Awaken is like the primo startup, and you and I grew up here in California. What's
            going on, Mark? What are you thinking?”
            <br><br>
            “I'm thinking about reinvention, Jimmy. I want to dive into photography full-time. I want a life, not just a
            paycheck. And I'm sort of sick of technology. I feel like it gets in the way too much. It distracts from
            real life. It just keeps growing until we forget who we are.”
            <br><br>
            “I thought your photography and the weddings you shoot were a side hustle? Mark, you can make way more money
            at Awaken. Don't get me wrong, you're an awesome photographer, but money matters, dude. It's security. And
            don't you want to be at the forefront of the AI revolution? It’s the future.”
            <br><br>
            “Yeah, Jimmy, I know. It scares me a little, to walk away. Artificial intelligence is the biggest thing in
            the industry right now. But it's…artificial. It's not real. Sure, it could change the world, but it's not
            what I want my life to be about.”
            <br><br>
            “What did your boss say?” Jimmy asked.
            <br><br>
            “My boss thinks I lost my shit. She said to take some time and think about it. But I've been thinking about
            it for a long time. I mean, look around, Jimmy. Everywhere we go, people have their heads lost in their
            devices. Including me. If I'm not checking emails, I'm scrolling through feeds. I want to spend more time
            with my head up, looking at the real world, not a bunch of artificial bullshit. I mean, ninety percent of
            the crap online is a waste of time.”
            <br><br>
            As a full-stack developer, Jimmy could relate. “Yeah, there are days I want to shoot my laptop and live a
            simpler life,” Jimmy said.
            <br><br>
            Mark slipped out a notebook wrapped in a soft leather cover.
            <br><br>
            “Uh-oh, here comes the notebook,” Jimmy said, knowing that Mark was a consummate reader and life-long
            journaler.
            <br><br>
            Mark began flipping through pages of dense notes, and then put his finger on a specific paragraph. He looked
            up at Jimmy with a grin.
            <br><br>
            “I sense words of wisdom are about to commence,” Jimmy said, taking another sip of his latte.
            <br><br>
            “People are a lot like cameras,” Mark began. “We let the outside world in, and we reflect it back in some
            way. But how much we let in, and how clearly we see it, depends on the lenses we wear. Some people have a
            wide- angle lens, and they see a lot, but miss the details. Others have a fast lens, and their field of view
            is tighter. Still, others have filters, that skew their view one way or another. We have to be careful
            because lenses affect reality. But in the end, what matters is the subject. What we're looking at.”
            <br><br>
            “What inspired all this?” Jimmy asked.
            <br><br>
            “I've been reading a book our project manager at work recommended. It's by Aidan McCullen. The title is
            Undisruptable: A Mindset of Permanent Reinvention for Individuals, Organisations and Life.”
            <br><br>
            Mark glanced down at his notebook and said, “Here, listen to this. I copied it down from the book.”
            <br><br>
            Mark began reading:
            <br><br>
            “Every time we add a lens, it modifies how we experience the world. The difference between that contraption
            and a world view is that each time a new lens is added to our world view, the lenses remain in place. We
            must be vigilant about the lenses we admit, because they colour our view of the world, sometimes to our
            disadvantage. They can limit us, encourage us to seek to confirm evidence and make us hold on to mental
            models, business models and convictions even when they no longer serve us.”
            <br><br>
            “Okay, so what's this got to do with you quitting your job and moving away?” Jimmy said.
            <br><br>
            “Well, I feel like I've had a lens cap on all this time. I couldn't see anything. I was blind to reality.
            But then, last summer, I took a backpacking trip in Montana. Remember?”
