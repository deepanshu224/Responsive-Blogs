        <div class="blog-content">
            When I went to college, I was given the advice, “You can be anything, but you cannot be everything.”
            <br><br>
            It was meant to be empowering, I think, but also reasonable — you know: Shoot for the stars — but stay
            grounded. The world is your oyster — but think it through first.
            <br><br>
            Looking back, that was the whole post-Great Recession, Obama-era vibe. We still regurgitated all those Y2K
            motivational poster platitudes but we tried to distance ourselves from the rancid optimism, tried to prove
            we were real and relevant without tangibly changing anything.
            <br><br>
            I wonder what my eighteen-year-old self would think of me now. That girl was still riding high on the
            promise of being promising, still thought being smart and “a pleasure to have in class” was a job. She had
            big dreams, vague dreams, something to do with saving the world. She got woke and realized international
            development had nothing to do with anything, got broke and realized being an anarchist is also not a job.
            Now she's almost thirty, with a dozen addresses in the past five years, in debt to her parents and scraping
            together a career change in the hope of finding stability.
            <br><br>
            The thing is, I don't really like stability. It's a necessary evil in my mind, something I lean into when
            riding the waves leaves me crashed and exhausted enough to stay put. Dolly Parton talked me out of a 9-to-5
            before adulthood could talk me into it, and I've wormed my way out of defining my career so far through a
            special combination of recklessness, idealism and dumb luck.
            <br><br>
            I like life better on the fringes of the world, where everyone's got big dreams and no one can pay the rent.
            I like the people I meet and the places I end up and the stories I have to tell after. I like this world
            where everyone's on their way from somewhere and not quite sure how they got here. Out there, you don't have
            to be everything. You don't have to be anything. You can just be.
            <br><br>
            The problem is that I was told I could be anything. Not only anything, but that I was gifted and talented
            and a pleasure to have in class enough that I could be something great. I could become a very, very good
            thing. The kind of thing the whole world would envy, the kind of thing people would kill to have the
            opportunity to become. An A+ thing. A winning thing. That was what they told me and for some reason, I
            believed it.
            <br><br>
            But in the face of that belief, I keep finding the truth. Like all that 90's optimism, the belief is going
            rancid.
            <br><br>
            I am, in fact, not anything.
            <br><br>
            I'm not a great writer or a successful revolutionary, not a world leader or a small business owner. I'm not
            yet a therapist, not still a traveler. I'm not really a punk or a hippie or a hipster or a yuppie. I'm not a
            Californian anymore, not really a Vermonter now, American by default but my ancestors sure weren't. I'm not
            a native or a guest. I'm not an us or a them. I'm not a Democrat or a Republican. I am neither joking nor
            serious, nor a secret third thing.
            <br><br>
            I'm not lost and I don't need to find myself. I know exactly where I am. I'm here. I came from that way, I'm
            going this way. I'm not sure what I'm doing. I'm breathing. I exist. That is what I am. That's true.
            <br><br>
            They said I could be anything, so I became nothing. I am no thing. I'm really just a verb, a plural verb, a
            series of processes unfolding that include and transcend my body, include and transcend my past, include and
            transcend you.
            <br><br>
            But if I answered that to the question, “What are you doing with your life?” you'd laugh me out of the
            building, because the world is not interested in truth.
            <br><br>
            The world is interested in nouns.
            <br><br>
            We're obsessed with defining ourselves by career and achievement as if these were our identities. We are
            obsessed with defining our identities as if these were the truth.
