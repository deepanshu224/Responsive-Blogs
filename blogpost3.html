            In Clint Eastwood's directorial debut, he takes a time out in a psychological thriller to slow everything
            down for a love stroll through Big Sur. The shots are long, the pace slow as time itself and Roberta Flack's
            famous song, First Time Ever I Saw Your Face, plays out. In. Its. Entirety. I, like many, have this scene
            burned into my psyche for all eternity. It's a seminal film sequence that, for anyone who was alive at the
            time, came to define larger notions of romance and the beauty of nature. But it's slowwwwww.
            <br><br>
            Slow creates indelibleness.
            <br><br>
            Filmmaking changed after this. From the 80's forward, everything became about quick cuts, cross cuts and
            fast-paced editing.
            <br><br>
            How does this relate to where we are with AI?
            <br><br>
            Because it's a short walk from the fast-paced cuts of MTV videos to the constant scroll of social media and
            YouTube, where we glean only small drips of impressiveness and move on to the next one, ad infinitum. The
            scrolling is the entertainment. The entertainment… its entire job is to last 20 seconds and disappear.
            <br><br>
            A 5-minute stroll just doesn't play with today's algorithm.
            <br><br>
            AI is the end result of all of this. Because the entire role of imagery in our lives has changed. In the
            1980's, National Geographic Magazine boasted a readership of around 16 million. Like others, I would sit
            with the magazine and stare for long periods of time at beautiful spreads of worldly things. Today National
            Geographic's readership is under 3 million. For no other reason than we now have more and more access, more
            and more imagery… and less and less attention. To the point where the beauty and impressiveness of a single
            image has no value anymore.
            <br><br>
            The ease of creating imagery was born of having less reverence for it.
            <br><br>
            Consider the Instagram photographer who has circumvented the years of training that most professional
            photographers before them had to go through — posting photo after photo of their travels, their friends,
            models, street photography, food, everything, in an attempt to draw attention and pave their own path to
            photography success. All this with a blind eye toward the idea that these constant look-how-amazing-I-am
            images were headed off into the Internet unknowns, for free. What was the transaction if not personal
            success over the value and protection of those images? Of photography itself? AI wasn't developed on the
            backs of artists, but on the backs of would-be commercial artists.
            <br><br>
            In the world of commercialization, there is always a price.
            <br><br>
            AI is the price we paid for social media.
