            If you were wondering if the teens of TikTok saw Congress's hearing about the platform last week: They did.
            They saw it through TikTok Lives, with their favorite creators talking about it. They saw snippets of the
            hearing through news channels on TikTok (even CSPAN). They saw it via memes and edits of members of Congress
            asking if TikTok could “turn on their wifi” and if the app collected data about their “pupil dilation” to
            know what to “amplify.” Within an hour, those snippets had become so prevalent on the app that one set of
            creators made a video in which they repeated the silliest questions from Congress in the format of a
            military recitation. In a softer aesthetic, one creator made a song that played over a video of her standing
            below a mountain; it began “TikTok don't want your pupils” and ended “Are we going to lose our app because
            peepaw thinks China wants to steal his face?” The contrast between the early news coverage of the hearing by
            “traditional” media and the response to it from TikTok users could not be starker. While The New York Times
            ran with the headline “TikTok's CEO Struggles to Make His Case in Washington,” TikTok users were taking to
            the app to express their disappointment about the performance of Congress in the hearing, drawing attention
            to the widening gap between the expertise of the governors and the governed — particularly when it comes to
            technology policy.
            <br><br>
            In many cases, Tik Tok users do not trust their representatives — neither their motivations for the ban, nor
            their fundamental knowledge of technology.
            <br><br>
            I am a social media researcher with a PhD; I'm in my mid-to-late thirties and live in NYC. My TikTok feed is
            probably quite influenced by those conditions. I cannot be certain that my feed looks like everyone else's
            feed, especially because I began liking and bookmarking videos as I saw them, which impacted the types of
            videos I saw next. But I suspect that what I saw on my feed demonstrates how many American TikTok users are
            interpreting the logical inconsistencies of a proposed TikTok ban in relation to what they know about how
            data flows work online (which actually seems to be a lot). The videos I saw demonstrate that while TikTok
            users don't necessarily trust TikTok, they don't trust Facebook (Meta) or Google (Alphabet) either. And in
            many cases, they do not trust their representatives — neither their motivations for the ban, nor their
            fundamental knowledge of technology.
            <br><br>
            The reasons for that lack of trust are obvious and abundant. In one set of extremely popular videos, TikTok
            users looped and edited particularly egregious instances of gerontocratic members of Congress revealing
            their ignorance about how TikTok, or social media in general, worked. They made edits of Rep. Richard
            Hudson, a North Carolina Republican, when he asked “Mr. Chew, does TikTok access the home wifi network?” and
            poked fun at Rep. Buddy Cartier (R-Georgia) when Chew had to explain that the app only collects data about
            “pupils” when trying to determine where to place sunglasses on your face using a filter. In some of these
            videos, TikTokers affected deep Southern drawls, satirizing what they saw as a lack of expertise about
            technology among their representatives, stretching and blurring the boundaries between what was being asked
            in Congress and what they, perhaps, hear from their own relatives. A typical user comment was, “I can't tell
            if this is a joke or not, and that's scary.” Others seemed to cringe at how the hearing reflected on their
            country's reputation, noting “we're an international embarrassment as always.” And they pointed out the ways
            the arguments of members of Congress were inconsistent or hypocritical: “As if they don't use facial
            recognition software to unlock their own phones.”
            <br><br>
            In other videos, TikTokers created their own news analyses of the hearings. Some were particularly detailed.
            In one video, an entrepreneur named Nick Drom used Capitol Trades to look up the stock holdings of members
            of the House Energy and Commerce Committee to see who held Meta or Alphabet stock. He also looked up
            representatives' voting records on gun control, juxtaposing their comments about “protecting young people”
            from harm due to things they “saw” on TikTok with the existential threat that guns pose to young people in
            the United States (in fact, the latest in an unending stream of school shootings happened while the hearing
            was taking place). In a simpler variation of the same idea, a video featured the popular meme of actor Pedro
            Pascal eating a sandwich, juxtaposed with a matrix that distinguishes what the American government “will
            protect us from” (TikTok) from what it won't (“cancer-causing ingredients in food, school shootings, income
            inequality, vinyl chloride train derailments, recession, starvation, lead poisoning in water”). In another
            video, a man stares into the camera and promises to tell the viewer “why Congress was right about TikTok”
            and why these hearings are taking place — and then proceeds to list data security and privacy concerns that
            are actually attributable to Meta (such as being fined over a data leak involving more than 533 million
            users, and giving data access to a Chinese company that was flagged by US intelligence). In the comments on
            that video, users blame Mark Zuckerberg in particular for the prospect of a TikTok ban, saying “Zuckerberg
            is the problem” and “Mark Zuckerberg has congress in his pocket” and “Mark Zuckerberg is losing money that's
            why this is happening.”
